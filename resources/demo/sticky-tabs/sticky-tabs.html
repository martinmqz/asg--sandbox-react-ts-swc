                What is the biggest risk that equity investors face today?
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Bryant VanCronkhite:</strong> In my view, the most
                underappreciated development for equity markets today is the
                paradigm shift that has taken place in monetary policy following
                the pandemic. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of
                supporting price stability and full employment. Other central
                banks have similar competing objectives. The fundamental
                challenge today is that pursuing both goals will require
                increasingly different policy prescriptions going forward.
                Something will have to give, and I think this fact is still
                dawning on markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                What changed? In the decades leading up to the pandemic,
                inflationary pressures created by massive liquidity injections
                and ultra-low interest rates were offset by deflationary
                megatrends, including the offshoring of production to low-cost
                centers, productivity improvements from technology and
                automation, and relatively cheap and flexible energy supplies.
                Today, some of the deflationary trends related to globalization
                have been reversed by ongoing supply chain disruptions, reduced
                exploration and development of traditional energy supplies, and
                emerging geopolitical tensions, and it looks like these changes
                may be long lasting. Markets are now coming to terms with
                structurally higher prices and a growing recognition that
                central banks may be unwilling or unable to step in and spur
                growth as they had in the past. Everyone is talking about this
                now, but I think few have fully comprehended the end game.

              <h3 class="question">
                What happened in U.S. growth equities in 2022, and what concerns
                are top of mind for investors in 2023?
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Michael Smith:</strong> It's no secret that U.S. growth
                stocks had a dismal year last year, underperforming value stocks
                and broad equity markets. A main contributor to this outcome was
                sharply rising interest rates throughout the year. The effect of
                higher rates on growth stocks has been outsized because a
                greater proportion of their value is tied to distant earnings
                that are now subject to significantly higher discount rates.
                This has brought growth valuations down considerably. However,
                growth company earnings estimates have shown impressive
                resiliency and, in some cases, have even risen over the course
                of the year. This suggests to us that multiple compression has
                been responsible for most of the growth equity declines in 2022.
                Against this backdrop, the most common concern investors have
                looking into 2023 is whether the coast is clear to reallocate to
                growth equities or whether fears of a recession should keep
                investors on the sidelines for now.

                What risks are top of mind for investors in emerging market
                equities today?
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Alison Shimada:</strong> Two headline risks preoccupied
                investors for much of 2022. One of these was the conflict in
                Ukraine. It's not clear yet what the end game looks like, but
                the war has upset global markets for agricultural and energy
                commodities and is shifting longstanding trade and political
                alignments. Another concern was China, which always looms large
                on investors' minds. We are encouraged by China's recent
                policies to support its property sector, its pivot away from
                zero-COVID policies, and the improved potential for reopening.
                However, the lockdowns have created further impetus for
                corporate managers to rethink supply chains. Moreover, President
                Xi has solidified political control and challenged regional
                competitors over its Taiwan reunification and “Belt and Road”
                ambitions. All of these geopolitical risks have weighed on
                global growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2023
                global growth forecast from 3.8% to 2.7% in October. Emerging
                market growth expectations have been downgraded from 4.7% to
                3.7%, but developed market growth expectations have been hit
                harder, falling from 2.6% to 1.1%. Emerging markets have been
                more resilient in sustaining growth—historically, a rising
                growth differential between emerging and developed markets has
                led to emerging market outperformance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emerging market currencies have held up better than major
                developed market currencies against a strengthening U.S. dollar.
                Some countries were proactive in managing monetary policy
                against rising inflation expectations back in 2021, which is
                paying off now. The Brazilian real, Mexican peso, and Peruvian
                sol appreciated against the U.S. dollar in 2022, and certain
                Latin American countries are well positioned to capture a
                greater share of global agricultural trade and investment from
                realignment of supply chains. So, overall, emerging markets
                present a mixed bag of risks and opportunities.

                Given equity market turmoil, how can Systematic Edge help

                <strong>Peter Weidner:</strong> The sharp and simultaneous
                drawdown in equities and fixed income led to significant losses
                across investors' broad portfolios—all at a time when inflation
                has been climbing. There are two elements at play: Seeking
                return in the face of market headwinds and delivering income to
                meet investor needs. Fortunately, technology has made targeting
                these attributes simpler, cheaper, and more accessible to nearly
                any investor. We've done a lot of work in this area.

                When equities and bonds both sell off, it can feel like there's
                nowhere to hide. But liquid alternatives strategies can help
                generate return with less exposure to these asset classes. Our
                approach is to build portfolios that are designed to harness
                some of these dynamics to the benefit of our clients. For
                instance, high beta, or highly market-sensitive assets, are
                often darlings in bull markets. Their riskiness can be
                beneficial when all assets are rising together. However, they
                come with significant volatility. This may not be an
                earth-shattering observation, but consider that high volatility
                reduces one of the most powerful effects in investing:
                compounding. The nearby chart shows average and compound returns
                of market beta quintiles of the MSCI World Index since January
                1997. Over the long run, more volatile assets have generated
                similar average returns but much lower compound returns. The
                compound return of the highest-beta stocks is up to 40% lower
                than peers!

              <p>
                <strong>For much of the past 15 years</strong> the Fed
                maintained a zero-interest-rate policy. Other global central
                banks took rates deep into negative territory. This period of
                ultra-low rates across global fixed income markets was a game
                changer for cash investors and for those looking to preserve
                principal and earn income above the rate of inflation. With few
                options to generate income and a meaningful return, many
                investors felt the pressure of TINA (“There Is No Alternative”
                to adding risk) and shifted allocations from traditional
                publicly traded fixed income markets into equities and private
                markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Toward the end of this period, ultra-loose monetary policy
                collided with two massive global supply-side shocks within a
                two-year span: COVID-19 and war in Eastern Europe. This ignited
                an inflationary surge not seen in nearly half a century. To
                realign monetary policy with the new macroeconomic landscape,
                the Fed raised rates faster and higher in 2022 than at any other
                time in history. Byproducts of this record-breaking policy shift
                were an increase in yields at the front end of the yield curve
                and a sharp repricing of much of the global bond market. Today,
                yields are close to their highest levels in 15 years.

                Much of the bond market has followed the upward move in
                front-end yields, and wider spreads have pushed credit yields
                even higher. As a result, all-in yields across many fixed income
                sectors are close to their highest levels in over a decade and

                believe fixed income investors will be compensated for both

              <p>
                Core inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index [CPI]
                excluding food and energy) recently peaked at 6.25%. The Fed has
                stated it intends to drive this measure down toward 2.00% over
                the next two years. To do so, it will likely need to raise rates
                above current inflation and maintain that rate until inflation
                falls close to target. Since both the inflation rate and the
                federal funds rate are moving targets, we expect them to cross
                at around 5% sometime during the first half of 2023. If and when
                this occurs, the Fed would be viewed as “ahead of the curve” and
                would likely become more deliberate and, importantly, patient
                with monetary policy changes. Indeed, Fed Chair Powell suggested
                as much during a recent Brookings Institute speech.[1]

              <h3>Taming inflation</h3>
              <p>
                To protect purchasing power, returns must beat inflation.
                Inflation is a curious beast, resulting from the interplay
                between supply and demand with many factors affecting both sides
                of the equation. The cost of debt is a dominant factor because
                borrowing costs directly influence economic behavior. Tighter
                policy has begun to reduce inflationary pressures but has yet to
                fully tame inflation. Over time, however, tighter policy should
                dampen demand and shake out weak borrowers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The supply side of the economy suffered a sequence of meaningful
                shocks in 2020 and early in 2022. Recent data suggest supply
                chains are slowly realigning but are still far from pre-COVID-19
                conditions. Frictional costs will likely remain high, and supply
                constraints should persist. We expect further improvement this
                year, but there are looming threats that suggest improvements
                will be slow and hard fought. These include tight labor markets,
                volatile energy supplies, global drought conditions, and China's
                seemingly perennial zero-COVID-19 policy. Despite these risks,
                supply-side improvements should help reduce inflationary
                pressures.

                Against a backdrop of tight monetary policy and tangled supply
                chains, it is no surprise that global growth continues to slow.
                Some countries are worse off than others, especially the U.K.
                and countries in the eurozone. Their proximity to the war in
                Ukraine and their continued adjustment away from Russian energy
                loom over their outlooks. Slowdowns in areas like Australia and
                China may be mild and short-lived, especially since China's
                slowdown is self-inflicted from its zero-COVID-19 policy. U.S.
                consumption has shown resilience, but manufacturing is still
                struggling. Consumer preferences are quickly shifting toward
                lower-priced items, and rate-driven demand is well past its
                peak. These trends are likely to persist deep into 2023 as
                economies groan under the weight of tighter monetary policy and
                slide toward recession. However, continued growth challenges
                will likely aid the Fed's plight to tame inflation as weaker
                demand eases price pressures.
              </p>
              <p>
                In sum, tight monetary policy, slowly improving supply chains,
                and sluggish demand should help constrain inflation pressures
                and preserve the purchasing power of income generated from bond
                funds going forward.

              <p>
                In addition to building a generous income stream, current yield
                levels offer a larger buffer against volatility than offered in
                the recent past. For example, in late 2021, the U.S. Treasury
                2-year note yielded about 0.50%. From this level, yields could
                rise only 25 bps (bps; 100 bps equal 1.00%) before an investor
                would generate a mark-to-market loss over a one-year holding
                period. However, in December 2022, the same note yielded about
                4.25%, which implies a breakeven buffer of 225 bps. In other
                words, the U.S. Treasury 2-year note would need to rise to 6.50%
                for an investor to generate a negative mark-to-market return
                over a one-year holding period. While such a move is certainly
                possible—and to be fair, a move of that magnitude already
                happened in 2022—the economic conditions are much different
                today from a year ago. With the Fed deep into a tightening
                cycle, growth decelerating, and inflation showing signs of
                cooling, it seems unlikely that this much cushion would be
                necessary to cover the risk. For bond investors, this presents
                an attractive opportunity to capture positive real yield over
                time.

                All financial assets were negatively affected by the surge in
                inflation caused by COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and the
                subsequent increase in yields. The math tells us that future
                cash flows are worth less as discount rates increase. As such,
                it is no surprise that bonds—especially long-duration
                bonds—proved an inadequate hedge against other long-duration
                assets, such as equities in 2022 as inflation surged and the Fed
                increased policy yields to combat inflation. However, with bonds
                more attractively priced and yields more appropriately aligned
                with the current economic environment, bonds are better
                positioned to offset cyclical risks. As a result, there is a
                good chance that bonds will once again provide an effective
                counterbalance to the more cyclical assets in investors' broad
                portfolios.

                From 2019 through 2022, there were two significant equity<br />drawdowns—for
                very different reasons and with very different<br />drawdown
                profiles. These events confirmed our prior research<br />

                For example, our futures-based downside strategies worked<br />

                recovery was aggressive. The drawdown of 2022 was very<br />
                different: It was more like a grinding drawdown without a
                sharp<br />
                downside move until late summer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each different type of drawdown calls for a different
                solution.<br />Given that it's hard to predict what a future
                drawdown will look<br />like, it makes sense to us to diversify:
                Use a mixture of explicit<br />downside protection, such as
                options, or more implicit<br />
                protection from alternative strategies, like trend-following<br />
                strategies, which performed very well in 2022.

              <p>
                We examine the macro drivers of asset returns and risk
                through<br />
                the lens of what we call a “macro mosaic.” This means we<br />
                consider the interactions of the level, breadth, persistence,<br />
                volatility, and uncertainty of growth, interest rates, and<br />
                inflation. The macro story of 2022 was mostly about inflation.
                Inflation isn't a problem for traditional assets as long as it
                starts low, goes slow, and is supported by economic growth.
                That's what we saw in the first part of 2021. But then,
                inflation started<br />
                to rise more meaningfully as growth struggled and became more
                volatile.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, the macroeconomic picture might not improve much,<br />
                but at least markets have had an opportunity to adjust to the<br />
                uncertainty of rather somber growth and inflation outlooks.<br />
                Late in 2021, our analysis flagged a possible recession in
                early<br />
                2022, and it also indicated an unusually high amount of<br />
                inflation uncertainty. Now, we think things have flipped:<br />
                Inflation is likely to slow materially, and there is unusually
                high<br />
                growth uncertainty. Rates may have already reset—if not<br />
                overshot—to the upside. Considering the equity market<br />
                drawdown in 2022, we're also constructive on the outlook for<br />
                the broad equity market.

                Factors flipped in favor of fundamentals.
              </h3>
              <p>
                Factors are the features of assets that matter. There are many
                factors, but the most basic ones include momentum (how prices
                moved over the past year), carry (things like dividend yield and
                interest income), and value (prices relative to long-term
                fundamentals). Central bank influence over the past 15 years
                caused higher correlations and lower volatilities across assets,
                rewarding momentum more than value. In 2022, though, carry and
                value were resurrected.

                In the first half of 2022, momentum did relatively better than
                value or carry, but the market's worries about waning growth and
                persistently high inflation triggered a return to fundamentals,
                prompting investors to refocus on valuations and carry in the
                second half of the year. We believe investors' preference for
                strong fundamentals at reasonable prices is unlikely to fade
                quickly.

                Diversifying across factors could potentially make a portfolio
                more resilient than simply diversifying across traditional asset
                classes. This is important because a better-diversified
                portfolio may allow investors to stay invested, avoiding the
                whipsaw risk of abandoning a long-term strategy at the bottom
                vof the market and missing out on a market recovery. Considering
                the disappointing performance of traditional assets in 2022, a
                sharp recovery in 2023 can't be ruled out.

              </h3>
              <p>
                In any market environment, there are winners and losers.
                However, when the broad market sells off, as in January‒October
                2022, the “winners” might only be relative winners, meaning that
                they declined in value less than others did. So, focusing on
                finding relative-value opportunities, especially in a year like
                2022, can potentially add value to investors' portfolios. For
                example, we identified a number of companies in consumer
                staples—a relatively defensive sector without a lot of rate
                sensitivity—that delivered positive results compared with the
                broader market during 2022.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, regional divergences were amplified in 2022, so preferring
                U.S. equities over international equities was helpful. We don't
                think these regional differences will go away, but the market
                may have already priced in the U.S.'s brighter growth outlook
                compared with Europe's and the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) tighter
                monetary policy compared with the Bank of Japan's, which is
                still doing quantitative easing.

                >When markets sell off, it can be hard to find places to hide.
                When inflation risk is the markets' dominant risk, stocks and
                bonds can sell off together, as we saw in the first three
                quarters of 2022. Those “nowhere-to-hide markets” call for
                patience, downside risk management, or both. But nowhere-to-hide
                markets can give rise to “everyone-wins markets,” where stocks
                and bonds both do well once inflation risk subsides.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the past few decades, investors got accustomed to
                “risk-on” and “risk-off” markets, where growth risks were
                dominant and bonds rallied while equities sold off, or vice
                versa. These four different regimes—nowhere to hide, everyone
                wins, risk on, and risk off—are linked to the macroeconomic
                context and to central banks' reactions to the macroeconomic
                outlook. When inflation was low and stable, it was easy for
                central banks to intervene by cutting rates or expanding their
                balance sheets to deal with any prospective growth slowdown.
                Now, with inflation at the forefront, central banks are more
                concerned with inflationary risks than with growth risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether central banks' retreat from direct financial market
                intervention via shrinking their balance sheets is a structural
                (somewhat permanent) change remains to be seen. It's likely,
                though, that the banks will be more careful in coming back given
                their recent experience with high inflation. We think that
                different speeds of monetary adjustment should continue to
                create interesting relative-value opportunities for investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also believe that the absence of central bank interventions
                will likely mean that the famous “Fed put” (an implicit safety
                net provided through ample central bank liquidity) will be
                missing for a while. Structurally higher volatility is likely
                back, and it favors downside protection strategies. In our view,
                diversification is not dead despite its “heart attack” in 2022.
                However, adding more explicit protection strategies on top of
                diversification makes sense to us.

                their nature—are illiquid. It's hard to meet liquidity needs

                comes with having the flexibility to be patient in the midst of

                <strong>Learn from the past—don't invest for the past.</strong>
                In 2022, we saw the aftermath of the traditional monetary and
                fiscal policy responses to an unconventional problem: COVID-19.
                Traditional diversification strategies were not up to the task
                of handling unusual economic consequences. That's why we think
                investors may want to purposefully refine their view of
                portfolio construction by holistically considering the potential
                risks and opportunities of these five key dimensions of
                multi-asset investment management.

                <strong>As we enter 2023,</strong>we believe the need to
                thoroughly evaluate climate change's market impacts has never
                been clearer. Physical repercussions are not a distant prospect.
                They are current, potentially dire risks whose market
                implications are just beginning to be thoroughly evaluated.
              </p>
              <p>Consider several events of the past three years:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Droughts and floods have exacerbated the impacts of COVID-19
                  and Russia's war in Ukraine, stressing agricultural and energy
                  markets globally.

                  Following 22 years of nearly continuous drought, California
                  farmers expect to fallow 500,000 water-deprived acres over the
                  next four years.

                <li>
                  Northern Europe suffered a 9-billion-euro economic loss in
                  2022 due to drought, on account of record-low water levels in
                  the Rhine River and other major river corridors.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each of these events affected commodity and financial markets.
                Are they “one-offs”? Or do they mark the early stages of
                long-term secular shifts? Or both? We don't know, yet—and
                there's much to learn and consider. However, while the effects
                from COVID-19 and the invasion of Ukraine will likely subside
                over time, we believe the consequences of warmer temperatures
                are likely to grow more pronounced—magnifying market cycles and
                creating wider ranges for commodity and security prices with
                more volatility.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our view, this challenging situation creates opportunities
                for strategic, purposeful investing with the goal of delivering
                financial benefits for investors while addressing changing risk
                dynamics. To capture these opportunities, we conduct rigorous
                fundamental analyses through a cross-asset-class lens to form
                clear, informed investment perspectives. Our approach requires a
                strong focus on intermediate and longer-term effects of a
                changing climate, including the influence on energy and food
                prices and differences across geographies.

              The Mississippi River basin is by far the most important
              transportation corridor in the U.S. for crops, fertilizer, and
              energy commodities. The basin accounts for 92% of the country's
              agricultural exports and most of its livestock. Sixty percent of
              all grain exported from the U.S. is shipped on the Mississippi
              River through the Port of New Orleans and the Port of South
              Louisiana.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's therefore unsurprising that in October 2022, when drought
              drove the Mississippi River's water levels so low that barge
              traffic had to cease on portions of the river, markets reacted
              dramatically. As Figure 1 shows, barge rates spiked to a multiple
              of normal levels in the fourth quarter of 2022. In terms of
              economic impact, the drought's effects on crop growth were even
              more consequential—Figure 2 shows the huge drop in grain shipments
              that resulted.

              These extreme conditions developed at an inopportune time: It was
              the peak of the U.S. harvest, when barges heading downriver
              normally are busy carrying about 60% of U.S. grain exports to the
              world. Further upstream, barges transport petrochemicals,
              fertilizers, and raw materials essential to U.S. industry and
              agriculture. If barge traffic slows for an extended period,
              negative economic consequences are tangible and global. Logistical
              disruptions like these are among the many types of
              precipitation-driven costs. Another one—reduced crop yield—is also

              What's more, falling river levels allow salt water from the Gulf

              Europe experienced a very dry, hot summer in 2022 and its worst
              drought in 500 years. Wildfires ravaged parts of Western Europe in
              July, and droughts led to water scarcity, compromising
              agriculture, power production, and many other industries. The
              impacts of the war in Ukraine, a world recovering from the
              COVID-19 pandemic, and low rainfall drove strong inflationary
              pressure on food and energy prices in Europe and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crop yields in France, Romania, Spain, Portugal, and Italy
              suffered. In the Po River basin in Northern Italy, the rice
              harvest declined by 30%. Water rationing went into effect across
              Europe, from big cities like Paris to small villages in Southern
              Romania. In France, the drinking water for more than 100 towns had
              to be delivered by truck.

              Flowing from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea, the Rhine River is a
              major route for transporting chemicals, grains, and coal. During
              recent droughts (including 2022's), low water levels reduced barge
              capacity to 30% to 40% of normal. Alternatives to river
              transportation involve roads and rail, which are more expensive
              and emit more carbon into the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              High temperatures combined with low water levels continue to
              affect various areas of Europe's economy. Power plants depend on
              cool river water, and in France, warmer river water reduced
              nuclear power-generation capacity during the summer months.
              Hydropower generation also has dropped: A leading electricity
              producer in Romania, Hidroelectrica, produced one-third less
              electricity in the first half of 2022, and in Spain, hydropower
              fell by 44% over the same period. As a result, energy prices have
              climbed for Europe's consumers and businesses.

              We've summarized below the key takeaways from our latest research
              on the agri-food value chain.

                Extreme weather events in recent years made clear that high
                levels of precipitation, hurricanes, and related flooding are
                more frequently and severely disrupting markets in Europe and
                the U.S.
              </li>

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Importantly and unsurprisingly, precipitation levels affect crop
                production. As the distribution of weather events becomes more
                dispersed and asymmetric, so will agricultural output. Further,
                supply deficits of grain will be more likely than surpluses. In
                addition to agricultural commodity cost inflation, fertilizer
                and transportation costs may rise during rainfall deficits,
                further pressuring costs across the supply chain.

                  The demand for food will likely climb sharply, especially in
                  emerging markets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increasing wealth in emerging markets is changing consumer
                  preferences and driving greater demand for animal protein.
                  This will require more grain for feed, partially offset by a
                  growing shift away from beef (cattle are relatively
                  inefficient converters of plant protein to animal protein) to
                  whiter meats and fish, which are more efficient converters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unfarmed arable land will likely continue declining as
                  population and new food demand force new acreage into
                  production. This will make yield improvements the primary
                  lever to increase supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Food crops will increasingly compete with energy crops for
                  arable land. Biofuels and renewable diesel production are set
                  to increase sharply from already-high levels. For example, 40%
                  of U.S. corn production today is used to produce fuel. About
                  one-third of U.S. soybean production goes toward producing
                  biodiesel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Geopolitical tensions appear likely to rise in tandem with
                  income inequality. Government-imposed import and export
                  restrictions, like those occurring now in Eastern Europe,
                  could happen more often.

                  The world's agricultural supply base has become more
                  diversified and flexible. Brazil, for example, is a key
                  producer to meet growing demand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Global logistics chains have become more flexible. Rail and
                  trucking alternatives to shipping have proliferated, as has
                  the ability of large ports, like New Orleans', to import from
                  many sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Basic market forces can help mitigate the price effects.
                  Higher prices should stimulate more production capacity
                  through industrial and agricultural technology innovations
                  that can drive growth in productive acreage and crop yields.
                  In locations where consumers are supportive, genetically
                  modified crops can provide new food solutions. Separately, big
                  data and analytics are already driving higher crop yields. If
                  high commodity prices persist, there will likely be even more
                  investment in research and development to improve agronomic
                  outcomes.

            What is the biggest risk that equity investors face today?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Bryant VanCronkhite:</strong> In my view, the most
            underappreciated development for equity markets today is the
            paradigm shift that has taken place in monetary policy following the
            pandemic. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of supporting price
            stability and full employment. Other central banks have similar
            competing objectives. The fundamental challenge today is that
            pursuing both goals will require increasingly different policy
            prescriptions going forward. Something will have to give, and I
            think this fact is still dawning on markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            What changed? In the decades leading up to the pandemic,
            inflationary pressures created by massive liquidity injections and
            ultra-low interest rates were offset by deflationary megatrends,
            including the offshoring of production to low-cost centers,
            productivity improvements from technology and automation, and
            relatively cheap and flexible energy supplies. Today, some of the
            deflationary trends related to globalization have been reversed by
            ongoing supply chain disruptions, reduced exploration and
            development of traditional energy supplies, and emerging
            geopolitical tensions, and it looks like these changes may be long
            lasting. Markets are now coming to terms with structurally higher
            prices and a growing recognition that central banks may be unwilling
            or unable to step in and spur growth as they had in the past.
            Everyone is talking about this now, but I think few have fully
            comprehended the end game.

          <h3 class="question">
            What happened in U.S. growth equities in 2022, and what concerns are
            top of mind for investors in 2023?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Michael Smith:</strong> It's no secret that U.S. growth
            stocks had a dismal year last year, underperforming value stocks and
            broad equity markets. A main contributor to this outcome was sharply
            rising interest rates throughout the year. The effect of higher
            rates on growth stocks has been outsized because a greater
            proportion of their value is tied to distant earnings that are now
            subject to significantly higher discount rates. This has brought
            growth valuations down considerably. However, growth company
            earnings estimates have shown impressive resiliency and, in some
            cases, have even risen over the course of the year. This suggests to
            us that multiple compression has been responsible for most of the
            growth equity declines in 2022. Against this backdrop, the most
            common concern investors have looking into 2023 is whether the coast
            is clear to reallocate to growth equities or whether fears of a
            recession should keep investors on the sidelines for now.

                    The Global Long/Short Equity strategy seeks to exploit
                    inefficiency in global developed markets (MSCI World) by
                    building a long portfolio with exposure to fundamental

          <h3 class="question">
            What risks are top of mind for investors in emerging market equities
            today?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Alison Shimada:</strong> Two headline risks preoccupied
            investors for much of 2022. One of these was the conflict in
            Ukraine. It's not clear yet what the end game looks like, but the
            war has upset global markets for agricultural and energy commodities
            and is shifting longstanding trade and political alignments. Another
            concern was China, which always looms large on investors' minds. We
            are encouraged by China's recent policies to support its property
            sector, its pivot away from zero-COVID policies, and the improved
            potential for reopening. However, the lockdowns have created further
            impetus for corporate managers to rethink supply chains. Moreover,
            President Xi has solidified political control and challenged
            regional competitors over its Taiwan reunification and “Belt and
            Road” ambitions. All of these geopolitical risks have weighed on
            global growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2023 global
            growth forecast from 3.8% to 2.7% in October. Emerging market growth
            expectations have been downgraded from 4.7% to 3.7%, but developed
            market growth expectations have been hit harder, falling from 2.6%
            to 1.1%. Emerging markets have been more resilient in sustaining
            growth—historically, a rising growth differential between emerging
            and developed markets has led to emerging market outperformance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emerging market currencies have held up better than major developed
            market currencies against a strengthening U.S. dollar. Some
            countries were proactive in managing monetary policy against rising
            inflation expectations back in 2021, which is paying off now. The
            Brazilian real, Mexican peso, and Peruvian sol appreciated against
            the U.S. dollar in 2022, and certain Latin American countries are
            well positioned to capture a greater share of global agricultural
            trade and investment from realignment of supply chains. So, overall,
            emerging markets present a mixed bag of risks and opportunities.
